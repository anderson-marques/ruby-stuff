# Variables

- Variables are not objects

- They keep track of our object

- Variables allow us to easily reference objects in Ruby

- Variables will be undefined or act like an object

``` ruby
x = 1
y = "anderson"
```

- Variable names convension is adopt the `snake_case`

```ruby
is_good_variable_name = yes
```
