# Strings

```ruby
> "Hello"
=> "Hello"

> 'Hello'
=> "Hello"

> greeting = "Hello"
=> "Hello"

> target = 'world'
=> "world"

> greeting + ' ' + target
=> "Hello world"

> "ha"*5
=> "hahahahaha"

> "2"*2
=> "22" # Not 4!

# Escape is like in Java ;)
> 'I\'m escaped.'
=> "I'm escaped."

# Escape does not works in simple quotes
> puts '\ta\tb\n'
=> \ta\tb\n

# Interpolation works only on double quotes also
> puts "I want to say #{greeting} #{target}."
=> "I want to say Hello world."

> puts 'I want to say #{greeting} #{target}.'
=> "I want to say #{greeting} #{target}."

# Commom String methods
> "Hello".reverse
=> "olleH"

> "hello".capitalize
=> "Hello"

> "Hello".downcase
=> "hello"

> "Hello".upcase
=> "HELLO"

> "Hello".length
=> 5

# They can be chained
> "Hello".reverse.capitalize
=> "Olleh"

# Methods that change the value of reference usually ends with !
> a = " abc "
=> " abc "

> a.strip
=> "abc"

> a
=> " abc "

> a.strip!
=> "abc"

> a
=> "abc" # a value has changed

```
